# Gene Regulatory Network Visualizer
This Flask web application visualizes a 3D graph representing gene regulatory networks. Users can select a transcription factor (TF) of interest, and the app dynamically generates an interactive 3D subgraph centered around the chosen TF.

## Features

Interactive 3D Visualization: Explore gene regulatory relationships in a 3D space, providing a clear visual representation of complex interactions.
Transcription Factor Selection: Choose a specific TF from a dropdown list to focus the visualization on its immediate network.
Dynamic Subgraph Generation: The app creates a subgraph based on the selected TF, showcasing its connections with neighboring genes and other TFs.
Intuitive Interface: A simple and user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and interact with the visualization.
